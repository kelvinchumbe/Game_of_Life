Game of Life is a cellular automation devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. You interact with the game by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves as the rules of the game take effect. It is Turing complete. The rules of the game are: 
* A cell is either alive, or empty.
* If a living cell has 1 or 0 living neighbours, it dies.
* If a living cell has 4 or more neighbours, it dies.
* If a living cell has 2 or 3 neighbours, it remains alive.
* If an empty cell has exactly 3 living neighbours, it becomes alive.
